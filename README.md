Move to a directory you want the project to live, if you need these instructions, you are probably not a coder. It may be easier to just have it live in your `Documents` or `Desktop` folder. Once you move into the correct directory using `cd`, install homebrew to make acquring important tools for this project: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`. Once homebrew is established, then install `git`: `brew install git`. Git will allow you to access the code and make changes, if needed. 

### go to the correct directory

Example: `/Users/your-name/Workspace/spacebaconmusic`
